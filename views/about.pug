            | I am a fullstack javascript developer. My passion is to study the physics of the nature to better understand the future of mankind. As a result, I have worked as an educator for Physics and Maths.
            | I also have been participating in a number of extracurricular activities. I have learned what it means to work as a team, to communicate effectively, and to work with people who come from different backgrounds. I have shown initiatives to learn and challenge my views in order to gain new insights and grow as an intellectual.
            | Oh and did I mention that I love playing basketball and board games? Looking forward to connecting with you!
